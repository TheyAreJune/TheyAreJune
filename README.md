### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**TheyAreJune/TheyAreJune** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting a placeholder site set up for my content.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning calculus based physics, how to program simulations of observations, and animation with Manim.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment, sorry.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with the placeholder site. The background image randomly stopped working and won't come back, even if I use versions of the code that previously worked.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about propulsion systems!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: @TheyAreJune on Twitter! TheyAreJune@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Phi/Per/Perself (Said similarly to She/Her/Herself), They/Them
- âš¡ Fun fact: Ummmm I'll get back to you on that.
